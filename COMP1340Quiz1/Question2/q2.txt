The git status command is not mandatory but is much preferred because it 
allows a developer to see each step of the process and be absolutely clear 
what they are doing with each git command. If there is ever a problem 
with uploading using git, the git status command identifies the problem
and shows it in the error status. 

ls, git status and pwd are all shell commands, so they only work in bash. 
Node is specifically for javascript and the above commands are not part of 
javascript's language so nothing would result from it. To exit node, 
press control C C to go back to bash.
